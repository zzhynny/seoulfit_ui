"""Shared LM management for DSPy.

DSPy's global ``dspy.configure(lm=...)`` pins the LM to whichever thread
first called it. Streamlit reruns the script on a different ScriptRunner
thread when the user clicks Restart, which would then raise
``RuntimeError: dspy.settings can only be changed by the thread that
initially configured it``.

Instead we keep the ``dspy.LM`` instance as a module-level singleton and
expose ``lm_context()`` — a context manager that scopes the LM for the
current thread only. Every DSPy predictor call site wraps itself in this
context, so the global settings stay untouched and restarts are safe.
